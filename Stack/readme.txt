This is the readme file for Stack data structure.

This data structure contains only one class namely "Stack".
Methods:
- push() --> pushes an element at the top of the stack.
- pop() --> removes and returns the top element from the stack.
- peek() --> returns the top element without removing it.
- clear() --> clears all the elements of the stack.
- count() --> returns the no. of elements in the stack.
- to_array() --> converts the stack object into a python list.
- show() --> displays the stack object in the form of a python list.

NOTE:
--> Stacks are also called LIFO(Last In First Out) data structure.
--> Data can only be accessed and inserted at the top of the stack.
